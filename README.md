Weather.ipynb:
- Uses original dataset
- Inspected for cleaning
- Corrected obviously wrong values
- Saved corrected dataset as pickle file
- Implemented linear regression (first for just one city as a test, then for all cities)
- Used Lasso and, in particular, Ridge Regression to handle multicollinearity issues
- Evaluated and compared Ridge vs. Lasso: Ridge is better in prediction -> Ridge chosen (but Lasso would enable us to explain better, as it sets certain factor coefficients to zero)
- Interesting discoveries in red font
- Checked feature importance by using SHAP
- Also tried Counterfactual Explanations by using SHAP
- Explanations/reasons in orange font
